**Overview: Describe the overall goal of your project**
The goal of our project is to analyze the relationship between socioeconomic factors and education outcomes across different regions of the United States. 
By integrating data on socioeconomic indicators from the U.S. Census Bureau with education statistics from the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), 
we aim to uncover patterns and correlations that may reveal how factors like income and employment impact educational achievement.
This project will involve programmatically acquiring, integrating, and analyzing data from two sources with different formats and licenses. 
We will use Python, SQL, and visualization techniques to create an automated, reproducible workflow, 
producing insights that can inform discussions on education equity and policy interventions.

**Research Question(s): What is/are the question(s) you intend to address?**
1. How do socioeconomic factors (e.g., income, poverty rates, employment) influence education outcomes (e.g., graduation rates, test scores) across different U.S. regions?
2. Are there regional patterns in how socioeconomic factors correlate with educational achievements, and what might these patterns indicate about resource allocation or policy needs?

**Team: Clearly define team member roles and responsibilities**

**Datasets: Identify and describe the two datasets that you will use. If you are looking for ideas for datasets to use, please reach out via Campuswire.**

**Timeline: Document the plan and timeline for implementing your project including who will complete each task.**
